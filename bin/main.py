"""
The aim here is not to provide an accurate drug/compÄ± specific to a disease. Here the aim is to show how to create a predictive model to infer the activate compounds against a disease.

To do this, we first get the gene list provided by the user. 
The basic assumption is that we have prioritised list of genes that were inferred against a disease. 


Subsequnetly, the known activities against the list of genes are retrived from the ChEMBL database which is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. . We do not use the all the activities available in ChEMBL database. First, we apply several filtering steps 
to get more reliable bioactivities (i.e. )
The model should also be aware of the genes so the features of the genes can also be used.
